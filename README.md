# MinaArena

A Decentralised Gamified Marketplace on MiNA

# Idea
One idea to combine Mina and World ID to build a Pokemon-style game for web3 is to create a game where players can collect and trade digital creatures, with each creature represented as a non-fungible token (NFT) on the Mina blockchain <store their game assets> . 

Players would need to create a World ID to participate, which would enable them to authenticate their unique identity on the network while remaining anonymous. 

## How zkp would be useful ?

Zero knowledge proofs could be useful in this game to ensure the privacy and security of player data. For example, players could use ZKPs to prove ownership of their NFTs without revealing their identity or the specific tokens they hold. ZKPs could also be used to verify the authenticity of trades, ensuring that no one is able to cheat or scam others out of valuable assets. Additionally, ZKPs could be used to ensure the fairness of battles, ensuring that players cannot cheat or manipulate the outcome of a match. Overall, using zero knowledge proofs in this way would help to create a more secure and trustworthy game environment for players.

# Technologies to be used

Mina is an L1 blockchain based on zero-knowledge proofs (“ZKP”) with smart contracts written in TypeScript. It is the first cryptocurrency protocol with a succinct blockchain.

Mina Protocol uses zero-knowledge proofs to build a more ideal blockchain architecture.

World ID is a digital passport that lets a user prove they are a unique and real person while remaining anonymous. This happens through zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) and other privacy-preserving cryptographic mechanisms.

Lens Protocol allows developers to quickly and easily build web3 social applications.

### Future Work 

The Lens Protocol could be used to create a social aspect to the game, where players can chat with each other, join guilds or teams, and share their progress in the game.
Lens could be used to provide a social layer to the game, allowing players to interact and trade with each other, as well as compete in battles.

The game could involve battling other players' Pokemon characters in a decentralized, peer-to-peer fashion using smart contracts written in TypeScript on the Mina blockchain. 

To ensure player privacy, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) could be used to authenticate players' identities without revealing any personally identifiable information. 
The game could also reward players with Mina cryptocurrency for winning battles or completing quests, which they can use to buy new Pokemon characters or Lens tokens.

Overall, this Pokemon-style game could leverage the unique features of Mina, Lens, and World ID to create a fun and engaging web3 game that prioritizes privacy, security, and decentralization.
